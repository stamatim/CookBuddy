This simple messanger app is very easy to use.

1. Load the project into the IDE of your choice. I suggest Eclipse.

2. Run ChatServer.java.

3. Run ChatClient.java. This will give you a prompt to enter your name before connecting you to the server. 

4. Once connected to the server, you can see messages that other users type, along with their names. 

5. You can repeat running ChatClient.java to add more users to the server.
